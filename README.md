The repository contains the BIg basket analysis project completed by me in which we used various exploratory data analysis(EDA) techniques to extract meaningful insights from the BIg basket csv data. 

Big Basket Data Analytics and Price Prediction

This repository contains an analysis of purchase data from the online grocery platform Big Basket. The data is in a CSV file containing information such as product names, categories, manufacturers, quantity purchased, etc. 

I performed exploratory data analysis on this dataset to understand trends i
- Calculating summary statistics of the data such as mean, median, max, min, etc.

- Grouping products by category and analyzing sales patterns.

- Identifying top-selling products overall and within each category.

- Analyzing product pricing and predicting optimal market prices using regression modelling.

This CSV data and accompanying notebooks provide exciting insights into consumer grocery purchasing trends. The analysis techniques used can serve as examples for working with real-world e-commerce data. Feel free to use and adapt this analysis for your own projects!
